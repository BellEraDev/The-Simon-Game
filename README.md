# The-Simon-Game
The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.
